# CSC Summer School in High-Performance Computing 2017

This is the material repository for the high-performance computing summer school by CSC - Finnish IT Center for Science.

Feel free to fork this repository and work through the exercises. You can also add general notes to yourself (like how to compile files etc.) at the end of this readme file (`README.md`).
